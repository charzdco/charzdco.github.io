<h1>INTERVIEW with Chase D. Hampton. Get to know me! </h1>



<h2>01. Why did you choose the name CHARZD?</h2>

<p>When I was 20 yrs old. I named CHARZD by myself. Because, I want to be a Designer who is known as an enthusiastic and empowering individual.  So I needed such a meaningful name that lives up to who I am and aim to be. It took me a while to come up with an acronym that meant something strong and was also catchy and would stick. With CHARZD, it sounds a lot like CHARGED! So when you say Charge Up, similar to Power Up! Soon many people will be saying CHARZ UP! That's the reason why I made my name as it is.</p>

<h2>02. What is your biggest achievement so far?</h2>

<p>My biggest achievement has yet to come I believe. But my biggest thus far is being led back to God. I believe that through God, I can conquer all and overcome every single fear that lays ahead in my future.</p>

<h2>03. What or who inspires you and your work? </h2>

<p>My work is aiming to empower and enthuse not only the youth but the world as well. I am inspired by those who drive around in these BMW's and Mercedez- Benz' because though they have those expensive cars, you don't know what they are going through to keep that car at the end of the month; if they just happen to work to where they have gotten and are comfortably stable in finances, I want to be the one that pushes for those who cannot afford and want to push their work out there. Charzd is the company to bring your inspirations to. Empowering not only one dream, but hundreds at a time!</p>

<h2>04. What was your childhood dream?</h2>

<p>My childhood dream was to design video games.</p>

<h2>05. When did you know that you wanted to be a professional artist?</h2>

<p>When I was in 8th grade I began doing simple sketches. I was also in an after school program and a few summer camps and I pursued the art classes they offered. It all started when I sketched a person and it came out almost similar to the actual image. As I got older, I got more serious, started taking more and more advanced drawing and painting classes. I have always had an interest in graphics and posters, album covers, advertising and many more things having to do with Design in general. I knew I wanted to pursue Art & Design when I was 17 years old.</p>

<h2>06. If you're not an artist, what would you be?</h2>

<p>If I was not an artist, I think I'd be an average joe, working 2 jobs trying to afford my car note (not that I have one). I would not be who I am if it weren't for ART. Art is everything it is and more. It doesn't have one simple definition, it is also not complicated. If I weren't an artist, I'd be pursuing something along the lines of veterinary medicine. Honestly i'd be working in a factory somewhere with the way the job markets are today.</p>


<h2>07. Among the designs you have drawn, do you have any favorite?</h2>

<p>I feel that every artist has a drawing that represents where they are from. For one of my illustrations I brought the Chicago Skyline in and made it vector. I threw in a pattern that is popular in the fashion industry today and I believe will always be. With a typeface that looks like script to make it feel more homey, more vibrant. This one will always be a favorite due to the fact that I put a lot of thought behind this one and had a focus.</p>

<h2>08. What is your next big dream?</h2>

<p>My next big dream is always to inspire others, to make them feel they can be something and reach out to someone, that they are not alone. Someone cares and always will.</p>
